# RNAseq workshop
 
Create one document with your answers and upload it on MMS. Deadline is the 03rd Nov 2020 17:00 BST


 
NAME: 
 
1) What statistical test should be applied if the experimental design is only condition A vs condition B (with replicas)?

2) What statistical test should be applied if there are 2 or more factors in the experimental design?

3) In the differential expression (DE) gene analysis examples we analysed, 
these were subsets of the same data set. LOG2 fold change (can be thought of a 4 times) is a "standard"
threshold for classifying if a gene is DE or not (also with a false discovery threshold cut-off, for example P < 0.05, see the table). 
How many genes were DE at a cut off of LOG2 fold change in the 2 reps and 3 reps data sets?
Note, this can be +LOG fold change and -LOG fold change ...

4) Your answer to question 3, letâ€™s think some more about this.... Comparing the number of genes "identified" from the 2 reps and 3 reps results: 
Why is this number different? Expand this answer to say why this "result set: X reps " had the least? Does this make you think about 
experimental design more?

5) How many genes from the two and three replicas DE result-sets were common? How many were not common? 
Does this make you more cautious about interpreting results??

6) From the DE exon analysis, how many genes were identified which had differentially expressed exons in the experimental design?

7) What was the greatest number of DE exons identified within a single gene? Choose ANY one of the DE exon graphical output and 
explain the result

8) To answer the following, you will have to convert the DE exon gene names. See below. The gene name set can be given to you if you
 do not wish to code this. Of the genes identified in the DE exons set, how many were identified in the DE genes 2 and/ or 3 reps set?
 
9) Expand on 8) and discuss the "amount" of overlap ...its implications or why it is interesting. 


10) Write a short half a page feedback on the workshop and what you have learnt.

Extra task 1): For those of you who wanted a coding challenge (THIS IS NOT ASSESSED OR MARKED - but help can
be given if you want it. Submit your code at the end of the file):

The DE exon results had the original names changed, however, they were changed in a logical manner. 
For example, geneID: 22307 can through as having significantly changed DE exons in the analysis. 
Its original name was Mca22307. Another example is geneID: 756, original name Mca00756.

Thus all the original names start with Mca and are 5 numerical character. One more example to get that point across
geneID 1, would have originally been called Mca00001.

Can you write a script to convert all the gene IDs that came through the DE exon analysis to the original names?

Extra task 2): Write a script that compare this newly named DE exon list, to that of the DE gene lists for 2 and 3 reps?
How many genes are common between the DE exon set and DE gene set (2 and 3 reps). 

Extra task 3): Effectors are of interest in this field of research. In the file extra_task.txt there is a list of previously identified 
effectors and their annotation. Of the DE gene and DE exon list, and the overlap of these can you see if effectors were identified 
in these DE lists, and return their annotation?

EXTRA EXTRA bonus. Repeat all the above by comparing the GLM results vs the exact test.

You will need to install R and Rstudio:

R, I am using version 3.6.2, although this is old:
https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.6.2/
 

Open this with (if on Windows): ``Notepad++``. This is the king of text editors!

https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.2.html

Filezilla is ACE for transferring files. Drag and drop!


Enjoy!
